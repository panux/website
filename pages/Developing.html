<p class="flow-text">Before you start building packages, you will need to install Docker (for Linux) on your system.</p>
<p class="flow-text">Next, git clone the packages-main repository (<a href="https://github.com/panux/packages-main">https://github.com/panux/packages-main.git</a>). Then, cd into it.</p>
<p class="flow-text">To build a package, use make. The make target is the directory the package is in and the name of the package without a file extension seperated by a slash. For example, to build bash you would run: <code>make main/bash</code>. The resulting packages will be placed in a subdirectory called out. While the extension of these files is .tar.xz, they are actually uncompressed.</p>
