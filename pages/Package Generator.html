<p class="flow-text">In order to package software, the Panux packaging system uses a special package generator file format (.pkgen). The overall format of a .pkgen file is the YAML data format. A .pkgen contains the following sections:</p>
<ul class="collection">
    <li class="collection-item">packages (required) - the list of generated packages and their dependencies</li>
    <li class="collection-item">version (required) - the version of the package</li>
    <li class="collection-item">script (required) - a script to run to compile and package</li>
    <li class="collection-item">souces (optional) - the source files to download before packaging</li>
    <li class="collection-item">builddependencies (optional) - the packages to install before packaging</li>
    <li class="collection-item">data (optional) - user-provided data for use with templating</li>
</ul>
<p class="flow-text">Various parts of the package build file (most importantly the script and sources) are passed through Golang <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/">text/template</a> with the value set to the parsed YAML of the unprocessed .pkgen file.</p>

            <ul class="collection">
                <li class="collection-item">pkmv [filepath] [srcpkg] [destpkg] - moves a file from one package-output to another, automatically creating necessary parent directoies</li>
                <li class="collection-item">extract [name] [compression] - extracts a tar (src/[name]-[.Version].tar.[compression]) and renames the extracted directory to remove a trailing version (mv [name]-[.Version] [name])</li>
                <li class="collection-item">mvman [name] - moves the man directory (/usr/share/man) in the package output to the [name]-man package.</li>
                <li class="collection-item">mvhdr [name] - moves the header directory (/usr/include) in the package output to the [name]-headers package.</li>
                <li class="collection-item">configure [dir] - runs ./configure in the specified directory using arguments in .Data.configure</li>
                <li class="collection-item">confarch - returns the target architecture in a format usable with configure</li>

        <div class="collapsible-header">How It Works</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p class="flow-text">First, the file is read and unmarshaled as YAML into a struct (RawPackageGenerator in code). Then, all templates are evaluated and the results are placed into a new struct (PackageGenerator in code). Next, a makefile is generated and executed which downloads all of the sources and creates the directory structure. Afterwards, another makefile is generated with targets to install all build dependencies, execute the user provided script, and tar all generated packages. The directory structure containing the sources and makefile is then stored into a tar file.</p>
            <p class="flow-text">The tar is then extracted in the build environment. The makefile is then run with -j6, which seems to be the optimal number. The tars are then moved into the destination directory and the container terminates.</p>

        <div class="collapsible-body">
            <h3>Make-based</h3>
            <p class="flow-text">For make-based packages, you should use $(MAKE) -C [dir] in order to build the package and then again with the install target. For the install step, you must use the DESTDIR variable to point to the out directory for the main package with an absolute path. To get an absolute path, you can prefix your path with $(shell pwd). $(pwd) will not work since the script is inside a Makefile</p>
            <h3>Configure-Make-based</h3>
            <p class="flow-text">For packages that use ./configure before make, use (cd dir &amp;&amp; ./configure), putting appropriate options after configure. Some packages may require you to specify the platform. The appropriate platform for configure is usually {{"{{confarch}}"}}-unknown-linux-musl</p>
            <h3>CMake-based</h3>
            <p class="flow-text">For CMake-based packages, cmake must be added as a build dependency (it is not pre-installed in the package builder). First, make a directory inside the source directory called build. Then run (cd dir/build &amp;&amp; cmake ..) to generate Makefiles. Then, complete the rest of the build the same way as a make-based build.</p>

        <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p class="flow-text">The following convention is used for dividing packages into sub-packages:</p>
            <ul class="collection">
                <li class="collection-item">[package]-bin: executable binaries (when the main purpose of the package is not commands/daemons)</li>
                <li class="collection-item">[package]-headers: headers for the package (should depend on headers for packages it #includes)</li>
                <li class="collection-item">[package]-man: man-pages for the package</li>
                <li class="collection-item">[package]-info: documentation other than man-pages for the package</li>
                <li class="collection-item">[package]-dev: empty package which depends on headers and any other subpackages required for compiling</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
