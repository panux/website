<h1>What is Project Panux?</h1>
<p class="flow-text">Project Panux is a project to develop open-source software, mainly in the form of a Linux distro.</p>
<p class="flow-text">Panux is a lightweight Linux distro built from scratch. The goal of Panux is to be as customizable but easy-to-use as possible. It is currently in beta.</p>
<h3>What is different between Panux and other Linux distros?</h2>
<p class="flow-text">Panux is designed to be lightweight, but also uses a simple system to generate packages. This system is relatively fast, and runs in <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/panux/package-builder/">Docker</a> containers so that the build can be run on any machine.</p>
<h3>How can I get started with Panux?</h3>
<p class="flow-text">Unfortunately, the bootloader setup is still work in progress, so you cannot install Panux directly. However, Panux works very well in containers - so you can use it with Docker. There is also a <a href="https://demo.projectpanux.com">Live Demo</a> on our website using Docker containers.</p>
<h3>What distro is Panux based off of?</h3>
<p class="flow-text">Panux is a distro built from scratch - it is not based off of any other distro.</p>
<h3>How can I add and compile packages?</h3>
